excerpt: Where to find official information about Syscoin Core and how you can interact with other Syscoin Core users and developers.
---
Initially, syscoin.org was used to host the [original Syscoin paper](https://syscoin.org/syscoin.pdf) and became the homepage for the [Syscoin program](https://syscoin.org/en/download). The site evolved into a general educational resource for Syscoin, and is [not affiliated](https://syscoin.org/en/syscoin-core/about-site) with the modern Syscoin Core project. The Syscoin Core project's official website is syscoincore.org and while other websites continue to host information about Syscoin Core, their views do not represent Syscoin Core. We know that the Syscoin ecosystem can be confusing, and we are working hard to make these relationships more clear.

For development work, Syscoin Core mainly uses the `#syscoin-core-dev` IRC channel on Freenode, [Github](https://github.com/syscoin/syscoin), and [the syscoin-dev mailing list](http://lists.linuxfoundation.org/pipermail/syscoin-dev/).

While there are many forums in which the Syscoin community and, indeed, Syscoin Core contributors engage, Syscoin Core is not responsible for those forums or their policies, nor does Syscoin Core take official positions on the community's decisions to use them. Still, we believe it is critical that the Syscoin community be able to freely discuss and critique every aspect of Syscoin.

The Syscoin community can become extremely excited and heated when discussing Syscoin, but we must all work to maintain a civil tone. Community members should not engage in brigading, denial-of-service attacks, or otherwise disrupt healthy discussion and we should all do our best to assume good faith in absence of reason to believe otherwise.
