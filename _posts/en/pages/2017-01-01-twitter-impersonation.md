We are aware of several accounts on Twitter that violate [Twitter's
Impersonation Policy][] by pretending to be the Syscoin Core project or
well-known individuals associated with Syscoin Core.  These accounts
have been spreading false and misleading information about Syscoin Core
and its contributors.

If you see one of these accounts, you may [report it to Twitter][].  If
you are reporting an issue about the Syscoin Core project and Twitter
asks that you enter the project's official email address, please use:
contact<span style="display:none"></span>@syscoin

This appears to be an unfortunately common issue on Twitter that affects
many other projects and individuals as well, so we urge you to carefully
evaluate any posts you see on Twitter---and elsewhere---to determine
whether or not they truly came from the indicated sender.

It is especially important to be careful about posts that recommend you
take an action that could potentially compromise your syscoins or your
computer, such as a suggestion that you download a newer version of
Syscoin software.  The latest version of Syscoin Core can always be
obtained from the [download page][], and for greater security you are
recommended to verify the binary integrity using PGP (see the [full node
guide][] for instructions).

The Syscoin Core project will never contact you to ask you to disclose
information from your Syscoin wallet, including your balance, addresses,
transactions, or private keys.  If you receive a security announcement
and aren't sure whether or not it is legitimate, you can safely shutdown
your Syscoin Core program to eliminate any immediate problems and give
yourself time to investigate.

Although Syscoin Core does have an official Twitter account,
[@syscoin][], any important announcements about the project will
also sent to our low-traffic [announcements mailing list][] or posted on
the [front page of this website][] (which also has an [RSS feed][]).  If
you know how to use PGP security software, subscribing to the mailing
list is particularly recommended as all announcements will be
cryptographically signed by a developer.
