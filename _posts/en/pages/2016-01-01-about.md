## About us

Syscoin Core is an [open source](https://opensource.org/) project which maintains and releases Syscoin client software called "Syscoin Core".

It is a direct descendant of the original Syscoin software client released by Satoshi Nakamoto after he published the famous [Syscoin whitepaper](/syscoin.pdf).

Syscoin Core consists of both "full-node" software for fully validating the blockchain as well as a syscoin wallet. The project also currently maintains related software such as the cryptography library [libsecp256k1](https://github.com/syscoin/secp256k1) and others located at [GitHub](https://github.com/syscoin).

Anyone can [contribute to Syscoin Core](/en/contribute/).
